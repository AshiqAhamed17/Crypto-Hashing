# SHA-256 Hashing in Node.js

This repository contains a simple Node.js script demonstrating how to use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to hash a given input string. The script utilizes Node.js's built-in `crypto` module to perform the hashing operation.

## Description

The provided `sha256.js` script generates a SHA-256 hash of a given input string and outputs the hash in hexadecimal format. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions and is widely used in various security applications and protocols.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or higher recommended)
